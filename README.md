Elite Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. We will be using a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud.

## Build And Run Instructions

Just download source code and unzip the downloaded folder and open project in Xcode.

## Using Terminal:

git clone https://github.com/mustafahussain388/Elite-Chat-App


## What we have Done

* Integrate third party libraries in our app using Cocoapods.
* Store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* Query and sort the Firebase database.
* Use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* Create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
